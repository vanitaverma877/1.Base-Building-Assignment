Q1.What is the Internet? Explain in your own words.

A.The Internet is a vast global network that connects millions 
of computers and devices, allowing them to communicate and 
share information with each other. It acts like a virtual 
highway that carries data, enabling people to access websites, 
send emails, stream videos, use social media, and more. 
Essentially, the Internet is the backbone of the digital 
world, enabling various services and applications to operate, 
and making information accessible from almost anywhere in the world.


Q2.What is  web browser? Explain in your own words.

A.A web browser is a software application that allows users to 
access and view websites on the Internet. It acts as a bridge 
between you and the vast amount of information available online. 
When you enter a website's address or click on a link, the web 
browser retrieves the content from the Internet and displays 
it on your screen. Popular web browsers include Google Chrome, 
Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Safari. They enable you 
to browse, search, and interact with web pages, watch videos, 
read articles, and use online services.


Q3.What is  browser engine? Explain in your own words.

A.A browser engine is the core part of a web browser that interprets 
and processes the code of a website, transforming it into the 
text, images, and interactive elements you see on your screen. 
It acts as the middleman between the web content (HTML, CSS, 
JavaScript) and the visual display. The engine handles tasks 
like layout rendering, interpreting scripts, and handling user 
input, ensuring that websites look and function correctly.

For example, in Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge, the browser 
engine is Blink, while in Firefox, it's Gecko. The engine is 
crucial in making sure that the websites load and behave as 
intended across different devices and platforms.


Q4.What is  static site? Explain in your own words.

A.A static site is a type of website that displays fixed content, 
meaning that the pages are pre-built and do not change dynamically 
based on user input or other data. Each page of a static site is 
created with HTML, CSS, and sometimes JavaScript, and is served 
to users exactly as it is stored on the server.

Unlike dynamic sites, which generate content on the fly (e.g., 
using databases or server-side scripts), static sites are 
straightforward and load quickly because there is no need for 
real-time processing. Static sites are often used for simple 
websites like blogs, portfolios, or informational pages where 
the content doesn't need to change frequently.


Q5.What is a dynamic site? Explain in your own words.

A.A dynamic site is a website that generates and displays content 
in real-time based on user interactions, data, or other conditions. 
Unlike static sites, where the content is fixed, dynamic sites 
pull data from databases or external sources, and the pages are 
created on-the-fly. This allows the website to display different 
content to different users, or update content automatically 
without requiring manual changes.

For example, social media platforms, e-commerce sites, and 
news websites are dynamic because they show personalized content, 
user-generated content, or frequently updated information. 
Dynamic sites often use server-side languages like PHP, Python, 
or Node.js, combined with databases, to deliver interactive 
and adaptable web experiences.
